LAB : Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

Objectives : In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
               i)  Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
               ii) Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.



Steps:
1) In the GCP Console, confirm that the APIs "Kubernetes Engine API", and "Container Registry API" are enabled.

2) Open Cloud Shell from the Console.

3)For convenience, place your zone into an environmental variable called MY_ZONE in the Cloud Shell by running:
 		"export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a".

4) Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster:
                "gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2".

5)Run and deploy a container, from your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container:
 		"kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10".

6)View the pod running the nginx container:
		"kubectl get pods".

7)Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
		"kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer".

8)View the new service:
  		"kubectl get services".

9)Test and contact the nginx container remotely using the displayed external IP address.

10)Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
		"kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3".

11)Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
		"kubectl get pods".

12)Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
		"kubectl get services".

13)Return to the web browser tab and refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.
